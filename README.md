## Overview
NorskSkrivetrening is a tool for improving your written Norwegian. It provides a series of translation excercises that ramp up in difficulty, giving you a benchmark for their current level of ability. Evaluations are made using a first pass with LanguageTool, and then a final evaluation with detailed feedback generated by an LMM.
